# tcf_getit

This project was originally create at the end of 2021 and is a quick (rough) prototype of a concept I had to further my knowledge of flutter and dart. 

This app was for my CrossFit affiliate that allow users to quickly access various CrossFit workouts that leverages the [SugarWOD](https://www.sugarwod.com/) API.

Packages of interest used in this project from a learning perspective: [https://pub.dev/packages/provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) [Chopper](https://pub.dev/packages/chopper) is an http client generator for Dart and Flutter using source_gen and inspired by Retrofit, [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) a simple Service Locator for Dart and Flutter projects with some additional goodies highly inspired by [Splat](https://github.com/reactiveui/splat), [intl](https://pub.dev/packages?q=intl) provides internationalization and localization facilities, including message translation, plurals and genders, date/number formatting and parsing, and bidirectional text.

**NOTE: You will need a [SugarWOD API](https://www.sugarwod.com/fitness-software-developers/) to run this project (Not included)**
